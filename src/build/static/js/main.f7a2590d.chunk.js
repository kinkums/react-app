The goal of this\n       discipline is to strike a balance between body, mind and breath, with the ultimate aim of attaining\n       self-enlightenment. It has been estimated by some scholars that Yoga is about 5000 years old.\n       Several scientists also claim that it is a highly developed and scientific discipline for healthy\n       living that has been perfected through milleniums.',"Lord Krishna says to Arjuna: \u201cHowsoever men approach Me, even so\n      do I reward them, for, the path men take from every side, is Mine, O Partha.\u201d The four paths are: the\n      path of work (Karma-Yoga), the path of devotion or love (Bhakti-Yoga), the path of psychic control\n      (Raja-Yoga) and the path of self-analysis and knowledge (Jnana-Yoga)."]},{name:"south-america",title:"Fascinating Things to do in South America",content:["There are experiences on a trip to South America which you can enjoy that are different and unusual\u2026\n       and you don\u2019t have to hack your way through the Amazon jungle or climb the Andes Mountains..","Take a Helicopter Ride Over Iguassu Falls","This waterfall is shared by three different countries \u2013 Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. However,\n       just about all visitors will view it from Argentina and/or Brazil. Iguassu Falls (or as the \n      Argentineans call it, Iguazu Falls) has the largest average annual flow of water, more than any\n      other waterfall in the world. About three-quarters of the total length of the falls are on\n      the Argentinean side. The most impressive part of the falls is called Devil\u2019s Throat, shared between\n      both sides. One way to really experience the dramatic majesty of these falls on Argentina tours\n      is to take an unforgettable helicopter ride from Foz do Iguacu on the Brazilian side.","Stargaze in the Atacama Desert, Chile","The Atacama Desert stretches a distance of 1000 kilometres/620 miles to the north of Santiago.\n       It is known as the driest place in the world with some areas having no recorded incidence of rain.\n       The spectacular landscapes are breathtaking.
